DESCRIPTION
-----------

This version of LMX is specially addapted to RT systems, and distributed 
for its deployment on the JET systems under the terms of the GNU-LGPL. See 
COPYING.LESSER for a full description of the license, and ChangeLog for 
differences with respect to the available LMX.


LMX is a library for numerical computations, including matrix and vector 
algebra, linear and nonlinear solvers, ordinary diﬀerential systems manipu- 
lation and both explicit and implicit integrators. 

The programming language used is standard C++ and code design fea- 
tures generic programming by the intense use of templates, allowing the use 
of diﬀerent numeric types without any change in the way functions are called 
or operators are used. Top level class design is not full generic as it letting 
switch between diﬀerent matrix types after compiling the code. 

The goals that where sought during design and development – and hope- 
fully reached – are mainly the following: 

• Intuitive (math-like) code is generated, not requiring speciﬁc training 
and reducing maintenance time in LMX-based applications. Eﬃcient 
functions are also available –replacing overloaded operators– for faster 
execution. 

• As a consequence of the use of templates, diﬀerent numerical types are 
treated the same way. 

• Once the code of a LMX-based application has been developed, chang- 
ing the type of matrices and vectors used doesn’t require any modiﬁ- 
cation and can be implemented as a run-time option. The same works 
for linear and non-linear solvers. 

• Any other algebra and numerical solvers library can be linked easily 
and then used with LMX-like code. 

• All the facilities of object oriented programming (OOP) have been 
deeply studied and applied since design stage reducing maintenance, 
support and future development eﬀorts. 

• Code is thorough documented and a (developers) reference manual is 
available.
